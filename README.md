# KeyTree
KeyTree is my personal project to make a freely available password manager, it's basis is using the 100DaysOfPython password manager, but heavily modified and added onto.

Currently Supported Features:
- Close with ESC
- Adding default email to default_email.txt
- Website name, Username/Email and Password are stored in formatted JSON
- Search JSON if website already has Username/Email and Password
- Generates random password with letters, numbers, and normally allowed special characters

TODO:
- Add checkboxes for special characters being enabled/disabled
- Add password copy-to-clipboard function in some capacity
